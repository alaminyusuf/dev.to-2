# My Comeback As A Javascript Developer

Hello everyone today I'm writing about how I wish to make myself more productive using my knowlodge of web development and the current trend **Web3.0**

I came to reliaze that online presence makes a difference as an open source developer, it is hard to say I don't usually give attention to what I want verses what I actually need

## What I Need

What I needed was isn't technical know-how alone but;

1. Communication skills
2. Open Source contributions
3. Solve a **Real life Problem**
4. Under the hood processes
5. Not only **Passion** but **Determination** is required is required

## What I thought I Needed

I started learning _web development_ self-taught since 2019, then all I wanted was a change in hobby, I didn't reliaze it would be a game-changing decision in my future and had many chances of making a living. As usual every developer's dream was to work at a Silicon-Valley based IT firm especially **FAANG**, like everyone I also had passion for such type of work. Since then my thougths were;

1. I need to be a **black-belt with** _Problem-Solving and Algorithms_ to land a dream job
2. Working with FAANG guarantees a successful career
3. Freelancing or building SaaS or even Content-Creation requires some defined set of skills

There's alot more to programming than happing a successful code compile, one of which inlude having your code merged into an large scale open-source project or giving an answer to a question in sites like _stack-overflow_ and gtting massive upvotes or knowing you inspired someone into the tech-world

I hope by the end of this year I don't find any regrets about what I should have learned or did this year

With that said I hope y'all find this writing inspiring, I'll be sure to write more contents using this meduim and many more
